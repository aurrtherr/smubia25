# Entity Relationship Diagram and Word Cloud Generator

## Overview
Our solution is a web application designed to extract relationships between entities from text, supporting input in the form of PDFs, public URLs, or plain text. With a few clicks, users can upload their files into the website and generate two powerful visualizations: an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** and a **Word Cloud (WC)**.

## Key Features
From the Entity Relationship Diagram, users can easily identify **key concepts, themes, and relationships** within their text. The diagram reveals insights into relationships between entities, represented as directional arrows, highlighting causal or hierarchical relationships. The Word Cloud, on the other hand, provides a snapshot of key themes and topics through word frequency analysis, helping users quickly identify recurring patterns and trends for **sentiment analysis** and **thematic understanding**.

## Functionality
The solution efficiently extracts, analyzes, and visualizes relationships within unstructured text. It supports various input formats such as PDFs, raw text, and website URLs, ensuring versatility for different user needs. By leveraging **pre-trained models**, the system accurately identifies key entities, including people, organizations, and locations. Relationships are identified through verb and prepositional pattern matching, structuring the extracted relationships into a dictionary format. This data serves as the basis for generating an **entity network graph**.
